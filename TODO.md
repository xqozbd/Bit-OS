# BitOS TODO

## Completed
- [x] Grab info from CMOS such as time and date.
- [x] Set up IDT and exception handlers (avoid triple-faults, enable debug output).
- [x] Add serial logger (COM1) for early-boot diagnostics.
- [x] Implement physical memory map parsing (Limine memmap request).
- [x] Build a simple physical frame allocator (bitmap).
- [x] Add paging + higher-half mapping.
- [x] Create a minimal kernel heap allocator.
- [x] Add a framebuffer status banner (BitOS version/build info).
- [x] Add keyboard input (PS/2 or HID later).
- [x] Interrupt-driven PS/2 keyboard (IRQ1) with key repeat.
- [x] Add a minimal console with built-in commands (help, ls, cd, pwd, time, mem, echo, ver, clear).
- [x] SMP bring-up (Limine MP).
- [x] PIT timer + uptime ticks.
- [x] APIC timer calibration and switch from PIT to APIC timer for scheduling.
- [x] Page fault handler with fault reason logging.
- [x] Limine module loading as an initramfs.
- [x] Basic VFS layer and in-memory FS for `ls/cd/cat`.
- [x] Line editing (backspace, left/right).
- [x] Heap free list (kfree).
- [x] Heap reallocation support (krealloc).
- [x] Syscall ABI stub + kernel-mode ELF loader.
- [x] Add in a cursor.
- [x] SMP bring-up and per-CPU data.
- [x] PCNet PCI probe + MAC read (VirtualBox card).
- [x] RTC sync to system time.
- [x] Preemptive scheduler with per-CPU run queues.

## Next
- [ ] Basic kernel thread API (create/join/exit).
- [ ] Proper sleep/timer queue (sleep ms).
- [ ] Userspace syscall table + minimal libc stubs.
- [ ] ELF loader: relocations + stack setup with argv/envp.
- [ ] Initramfs unpacker (tar or cpio) into VFS.
- [ ] VFS: path normalization + mount points.
- [ ] Memory protection: user/kernel page separation.
- [ ] Page fault recovery + kill userspace task.
- [ ] PCI enumeration: BAR sizing, MSI support, device driver registry.
- [ ] PCNet TX/RX ring buffers + basic ARP.
- [ ] Basic network stack (Ethernet + ARP + IPv4 + ICMP ping).
- [ ] PS/2 mouse packet sync + rate limiting improvements.
- [ ] Ring buffer logging + persistent crash dump to RAM.
- [ ] Shell history (up/down).
- [ ] Shell tab completion.
- [ ] Process/task model (PID, state, kernel stack, page table).
- [ ] Userspace memory allocator (brk/sbrk syscall).
- [ ] Keyboard line discipline (canonical mode, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V).
- [ ] Console output buffering + scrollback.
- [ ] Interrupt masking / IRQ priority routing.
- [ ] Driver registry (init order + status).
- [ ] ACPI parsing stub (device discovery).
- [ ] Kernel panic backtrace (stack walk).
- [ ] Framebuffer cursor sprite (separate from text caret).
- [ ] Configurable boot params (Limine cmdline).
